# Handwritten-digit-recognition-
Basic Image Classification! By the end of the project, you'd have created and trained a Neural Network model that, 
after the training, will be able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy and along the way,
you'd have developed a basic understanding of how Neural Networks work and you'd have developed a basic understanding of TensorFlow syntax with Keras as its front end.
